Chris Liu is a final-year undergraduate student at UC Santa Cruz. He is also an undergraduent student researcher at [Professor Jeffrey Flanigan](https://jflanigan.github.io/)'s NLP lab.

Chris's is interested in [natural language processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), [reinforcement learning (RL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) and [meta-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_learning). He will apply for master programs in fall 2020 and wishes to work on reinforcement learning and meta-learning, and incorporate the ideas into other fields. He wants to work on approaches that allow agents to learning multiple tasks efficiently.

## Projects
**Fine-Tuning GPT-2 to Generate Research Paper Abstracts** (Winner of CSE142 Text Generation Project Competition)
He trained a GPT-2 model to generate AI research paper abstracts. It is now publicly available ([model card link](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/model_cards/chrisliu298/arxiv_ai_gpt2)). To actually use the model, follow the instrction on the model card and generate text using [this Python script](https://gist.github.com/chrisliu298/ccb8144888eace069da64ad3e6472d64). It is also on [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisliu298/gpt2-arxiv)

**TAPT: Text Augmentation Using Pre-Trained Transformers With Reinforcement Learning**
During CSE115: Intro to Software Engineering, Yiyun Zheng, Jinfan Zhang, Tianyao Zheng, and Chris Liu colaborated on this project. In this project, they built a text data augmentation pipeline based on Transformer models and proximal policy optimization. It is also on [GitHub](https://github.com/chrisliu298/tapt).

## Interests
Chris enjoys reading any ML/NLP/RL papers.

He shares the same dream with many researchers out there, which is to build [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence).
