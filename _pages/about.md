I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at UC Santa Cruz. I also work as an undergraduate student researcher at [Professor Jeffrey Flanigan](https://jflanigan.github.io/)'s JLab and will join [Professor Xin (Eric) Wang](https://eric-xw.github.io/)'s lab in Fall 2020.

My research interests lie in [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and [meta-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_learning_(computer_science)) methods. Currently, I work closely with Professor Jeffrey Flanigan on a research project about
machine learning theory. For future research, I decide to work on approaches that emphasize the learning agent's generalization ability, which allow agents to learn multiple tasks with only a few examples efficiently.
