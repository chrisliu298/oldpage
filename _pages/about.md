Chris Liu is a final-year undergraduate student at UC Santa Cruz. He is also an undergraduate student researcher at [Professor Jeffrey Flanigan](https://jflanigan.github.io/)'s JLab and will join [Professor Xin (Eric) Wang](https://eric-xw.github.io/)'s lab in Fall 2020.

Chris's research interests lie in machine learning and [meta-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_learning_(computer_science)) methods. Currently, he is working closely with Professor Jeffrey Flanigan on a research project about
machine learning theory. For future research, he will work on approaches that emphasize the agent's generalization ability and allow agents to learn multiple tasks with minimal examples efficiently.
